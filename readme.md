# [Jam](jam-url)

A simple, lightweight Sass responsive front-end framework to normalise browser behaviour for accessible websites.

## Features

Jam is meant to be a starting point for every website or web app:

* A responsive grid that can be customised to your needs.

* A solid base built on [Normalize.css](normalize-url) to fix cross-browser compatibility
  issues.

* Consistently styled buttons that work with `<a>` and `<button>` elements.

* Styles for vertical and horizontal menus, including support for dropdown
  menus.

* Useful form alignments that look great on all screen sizes.

* Various common table styles.

* An extremely minimalist look that is super-easy to customise.

* Responsive by default, with a non-responsive option.

* Easy customisation.

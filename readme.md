Features
--------

Pure is meant to be a starting point for every website or web app. We take care
of all the CSS work that every site needs, without making it look cookie-cutter:

* A responsive grid that can be customized to your needs.

* A solid base built on [Normalize.css][] to fix cross-browser compatibility
  issues.

* Consistently styled buttons that work with `<a>` and `<button>` elements.

* Styles for vertical and horizontal menus, including support for dropdown
  menus.

* Useful form alignments that look great on all screen sizes.

* Various common table styles.

* An extremely minimalist look that is super-easy to customize.

* Responsive by default, with a non-responsive option.

* Easy customisation.

* Extremely small file size: **4.KB minified + gzip**.
